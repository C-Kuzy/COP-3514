 // What are Identifiers?

    // Identifiers are variables, functions, macros, and other entities we use as they contain letters, digits, and underscores (cannot start with a digit)
        // Examples:              times100          |          you_are_cool         |             power_of_3            |            _better

        // It is common practice to avoid using identifiers that begin with an underscore to avoid confusion with other variables or functions
        // Since C is case sensitive: There is a noticeable difference between lower and uppercase letters used in identifiers
